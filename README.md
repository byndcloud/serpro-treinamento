# qt-extensions-base

This is a template for creating Vue 2 Quoti extensions.

## Important
Use [quoti-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/quoti-cli) to work with your extensions.

## Working with the Vuex store
Modules can be created like in a normal Vuex project. There is an [example module](https://github.com/byndcloud/qt-extensions-base/tree/main/src/store/modules) registered in this template.
